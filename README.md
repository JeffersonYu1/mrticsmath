# Mr. Tics Math
Tools to enhance the execution of the annual Math Contest hosted by [Elkins High School](https://www.fortbendisd.com/ehs). Written by Jefferson Yu.

## About the Project
### Motivation
In simple terms, writing practice problems for the mental math (number sense) section of elementary school math contests takes quite a lot of time manually. Since the questions are formualic in nature, the idea of a practice problem generator came into play.

### Releases
The first version of Mr. Tics Math, v1.0.0, was released in 2017 directly onto the website. Small fixes were added every few months.

In 2019, v2.0.0 was released, which added major features such as the option to create a printable PDF of practice problems (along with their answers), as well as support for generating practice problems for another section of the math contests, the Calculator Applications category.

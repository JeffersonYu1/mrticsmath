# Mr. Tics Math
Practice problem generator to aid students in preparing for the [Number Sense and Calculator contests](https://www.tmsca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=62). Written by Jefferson Yu.

## About the Project
### Motivation
In simple terms, writing practice problems for the mental math (Number Sense) section of elementary school math contests takes quite a lot of time manually. As a math team coach, I felt that I was unable to keep up with the rate that my students were finishing practice papers. Since Number Sense questions are formualic in nature, the idea of a practice problem generator was born.

### Releases
The first version of Mr. Tics Math, v1.0.0, was released in 2017 directly onto the website. Small fixes were added every few months.

In 2019, v2.0.0 was released, which added major features such as the option to create a printable PDF of practice problems (along with their answers), as well as support for generating practice problems for another section of the math contests, the Calculator Applications category.

### Features
A majority of Number Sense questions come from the following categories. Users can select from over 80 categories of problems, and practice the various types of problems individually, with a small batch, or all together. 

A sample of some of the types of problems:

Practice can be done directly on the website. Mr. Tics keeps track of the number of problems attempted and correct for each session.

Practice problems can also be turned into a printable PDF with answers, such as the sample problems below:

In v2.0.0 and above, problems can also be generated for the Calculator Applications section of the contest. For instance:
